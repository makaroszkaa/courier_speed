## Predicting courier speed by route parameters

**Main question**: is it possible to predict how fast the courier will reach the place of delivery, taking into account the route, weather conditions, distance traveled?

Ð¡onditions: *courier goes only on foot*

**Sub-questions**:  

1. how to clear the data from the courier speed parameter where he did not go, but was driving?
2. how to find out the weather condition from GPS data at the time of the route?
3. how to train the model to predict speed based on weather conditions?
4. what data to prepare for model training?
5. which model to choose for forecasting?

Project **plan**: 

* answer the questions
* define the variables for the model
* to get data
* data cleaning (remove from the track the moment where the courier travels, but does not go)
* data analysis
* model writing
* model training
* interpretation of results
* model results
* description of the results obtained
* uploading the model to the site

## Action plan

Week 52, 2020:  

- draw up a project plan - see below;
- create a local project folder on your computer;
- put all raw data in the local folder;
- read the `GPX` files of hikes in the Python dataframe;
- write a short report for the week and make a work plan for the next;
