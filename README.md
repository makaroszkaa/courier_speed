## Predicting courier speed by route parameters

**Main question**: is it possible to predict how fast the courier will 
reach the place of delivery, taking into account the route, weather 
conditions, distance traveled?

Ð¡onditions: *courier goes only on foot*

**Sub-questions**:  

1. how to clear the data from the courier speed parameter where 
   he did not go, but was driving?  
2. how to find out the weather condition from GPS data at the time of 
   the route?  
3. how to train the model to predict speed based on weather conditions?  
4. what data to prepare for model training?  
5. which model to choose for forecasting?  

Project **plan**: 

* define the variables for the model  
* get data  
* data cleaning  
* data analysis  
* model writing  
* model training  
* interpretation of results  
* model results  
* description of the results obtained  
* uploading the model to the site  

## Action plan

Week 52, 2020:  

- draw up a project plan 							-- done  
- create a local project folder on your computer	-- done  
- put all raw data in the local folder				-- done  
- read the `GPX` files of hikes						-- done  
- save raw data in a `CSV` file						-- done  


Week 01, 2021:  

- define ideal dataset  
- find out what variables are missing from ideal  
- obtain missing variables  
- write up report -- see *Report reqs*  

*Report reqs*: your report must contain your ideal dataset and describe
why you choose the exact variables. You must write your report in `.md`
format and save it to `Github` as an update to `readme.md` file.
